An Interactive Graphic Display for Region
Partitioning by Linear Programming
.W
Using linear programming, an interactive graphic
display system has been implemented to solve 
the region design problem of partitioning a region into
N nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that 
their areas are in specified proportions and that the
total cost of servicing them is a minimum.  In 
a conversational manner, a user can easily obtain different
partitionings by specifying and modifying 
the boundary, the service centers' locations, the area
proportions, and the cost functions.  Examples 
are included.
