Levels of Computer Systems
.W
In building current computer systems, we tend
to break them down into "levels" of control, 
command and communication; in using the system, we break
our problems down correspondingly.  The continued 
use of such a structure raises questions about its effects
on the usefulness of future systems, particularly 
with regard to such trends as time sharing, parallel
programming, and, eventually, systems which learn. 
 In this essay some of these questions are posed, and
the general attitude we must take in pursuing the 
problem further is discussed.
