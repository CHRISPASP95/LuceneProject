A Rapid Method for Digital Filtering
.W
Since much of the computer time spent in time-series
analysis is used for multiplications, 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital
filtering, with the expectation that it would 
be useful in the on line, real-time analysis of biological
data.  The filters are constructed from a succession 
of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates
cascading.  The repertoire of frequency 
response curves includes relatively good low-pass and
band-pass designs.  Programs are available for 
implementing both the synthesis of these filters, and
their application on computers whose assemblers 
allow the definition of recursive macros.
