Testing a Random Number Generator
.W
The first 1,000,000 numbers produced by the
random number generator used in the General Purpose 
Systems Simulator (GPSS) were subjected to statistical
tests.  The tests are described and the results 
of the tests are presented.  These particular tests indicate
that the numbers are satisfactory.  It is 
recommended that suitable tests be applied to all
random numbers used in computer simulations.
