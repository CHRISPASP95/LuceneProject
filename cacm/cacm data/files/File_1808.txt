Advanced Cryptographic Techniques for Computers
.W
Cryptographic techniques which can be used to
maintain the confidentiality of information processed 
by computers are dealt with.  Special emphasis is paid
to the unique characteristics of computer files 
that make many cryptographic methods of little use.
 Relative security, costs, and preferred methods 
are included in this paper.
