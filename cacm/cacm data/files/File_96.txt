On Computing Radiation Integrals
.W
The relative merit and cost of four ways of
evaluating typical radiation integrals containing 
spherical Bessel functions are investigated.  These methods
are desk machine evaluation of a finite series, 
integration of the appropriate differential equation
by a Reeves Electronic Analog Computer and by a 
Litton 40 IBM 704 computer.  Results are generally applicable
to equations separated from a Helmholtz 
or wave equation.
