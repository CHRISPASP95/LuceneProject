Price/Performance Patterns of U.S. Computer Systems
.W
Econometric models of the U.S. computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between system price and hardware performance.  Single
measures of price/performance such as "Grosch's Law" are shown to
be so over simplified as to be meaningless.  Multiple-regression models
predicting system cost as a function of several hardware
characteristics do, however, reveal a market dichotomy.  On one hand there
exists a stable, price predictable market for larger, general
purpose computer systems.  The other market is the developing one
for small business computer systems, a market which is relatively
unstable with low price predictability.
