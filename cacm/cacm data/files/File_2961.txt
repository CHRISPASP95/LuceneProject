Experimental Investigations of the Utility
of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming
.W
This paper describes previous research on
flowcharts and a series of controlled experiments 
to test the utility of detailed flowcharts as an aid
to program composition, comprehension, debugging, 
and modification.  No statistically significant difference
between flowchart and nonflowchart groups 
has been shown, thereby calling into question the utility
of detailed flowcharting.  A program of further 
research is suggested.
