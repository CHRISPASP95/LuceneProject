A Deductive Question-Answer for Natural Language Inference
.W
The question-answering aspects of the Protosynthex III pro
totype language processing system are described and exemplified in
detail.  The system is written in LISP 1.5 and operates on the Q-32
time-sharing system.  The system's data structures and their semantic
organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated.  Examples of the
system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed.  It is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works
from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this
information.  It is concluded that the development of Protosynthex
III into a practically useful system to work with large data
bases is possible but will require changes in both the data
structures and the algorithms used for question answering.
