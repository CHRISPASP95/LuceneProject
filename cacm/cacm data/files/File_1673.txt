Approximate Solution of Initial Boundary Wave
Equation Problems by Boundary-Value Techniques
.W
A new boundary-value technique is proposed for
the treatment of initial-boundary-value problems 
for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations.   Several
illustrative examples are offered to demonstrate 
the ease with which the method can be applied.
