Code Extension in ASCII* (An ASA Tutorial)
.W
The American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number of control 
characters associated with the principle of code extension,
that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the Code.  The manner of use of these 
characters has not previously been completely described.
 This paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications,
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters.  Distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntactic
representation" which are often used to meet similar 
requirements.  Also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications.
 The material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the (proposed) ISO international
7-bit code for information interchange.
