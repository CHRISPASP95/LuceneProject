Some Basic Determinants of Computer Programming Productivity

The propose of this research was to examine
the relationship between processing characteristics 
of programs and experience characteristics of programmers
and program development time.  The ultimate 
objective was to develop a technique for predicting
the amount of time necessary to create a computer 
program.  The fifteen program characteristics hypothesized
as being associated with an increase in programming 
time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming
specifications.  The five programmer characteristics 
are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming
task is begun.  Nine program characteristics 
emerged as major influences on program development time,
each associated with increased program development 
time.  All five programmer characteristics were found
to be related to reduced program development time. 
 A multiple regression  equation which contained one programmer
characteristic and four program characteristics 
gave evidence of good predictive power for
forecasting program development time.
