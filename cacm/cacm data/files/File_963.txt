Relative Effects of Central Processor and Input-Output
Speeds Upon Throughput on the Large Computer
.W
Presented in this paper is a technique for
determining the relative effects of the internal 
speed of the computer and the speed of the input-output
units upon the overall speed of the system. Equations 
are derived which permit the determination of these
effects from hardware usage measurements.
