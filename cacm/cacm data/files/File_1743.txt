Reliable Full-Duplex file Transmission over Half-Duplex Telephone Lines
.W
A field-proven scheme for achieving reliable
duplex transmission over a half-duplex communication 
line is presented, and to demonstrate the difficulty
of the problem, another similar scheme, which is 
only slightly unreliable, is also presented.  A flowchart
for the reliable scheme and some interesting 
examples are given.
