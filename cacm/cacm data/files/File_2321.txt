On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems
.W
Future systems that combine computers, digital
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.  Several "standard" interfaces,
by means of which computers and digital 
terminals connect to the communications systems will
be required.  When specifying these interfaces, 
consideration must be given to problems of coordination,
synchronization, error control, signaling, stream 
multiplexing, and switch control, in addition to minimizing
the technological interdependence of specific 
subsystem designs.  A focus on some of the problems is
obtained in a discussion of a detailed specification 
for a particular computer-communications system interface.
