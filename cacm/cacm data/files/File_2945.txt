Certification of Programs for Secure Information Flow
.W
This paper presents a certification mechanism
for verifying the secure flow of information 
through a program.  Because it exploits the properties
of a lattice structure among security classes, 
the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can easily
be included in the analysis phase of most existing 
compilers.  Appropriate semantics are presented and
proved correct.  An important application is the 
confinement problem: The mechanism can prove that a program
cannot cause supposedly nonconfidential results 
to depend on confidential input data.
