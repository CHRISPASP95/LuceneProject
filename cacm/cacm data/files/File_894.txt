An Iterative Factorization Technique for Polynomials
.W
An iterative technique is displayed whereby factors
of arbitrary degree can be found for polynomials 
in one variable.  Convergence is shown to occur always
if a certain Jacobian does not vanish and if the 
initial approximation to a factor is near enough to an
actual factor.  The process is simply programmed, 
and preliminary results indicate it to be well adapted
to use with digital computers.  For factors of 
degree two, the technique is similar to that of Bairstow,
the present method being somewhat simpler.
