A Controlled Experiment in Program Testing
and Code Walkthroughs/Inspections
.W
This paper describes an experiment in program
testing, employing 59 highly experienced data 
processing professionals using seven methods to test
a small PL/I program.  The results show that the 
popular code walk through/inspection method was as effective
as other computer-based methods in finding 
errors and that the most effective methods (in terms of
errors found and cost) employed pairs of subjects 
who tested the program independently and then pooled
their findings.  The study also shows that there 
is a tremendous amount of variability among subjects
and that the ability to detect certain types of 
errors varies from method to method.
