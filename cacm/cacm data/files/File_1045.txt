Programming Analysis of Variance by Sequences
of Operators and Isomorphic Mappings
.W
A special operator calculus developed by Hartley
in 1956 together with a new mapping scheme 
has been found to be efficient in programming analysis
of variance for multifactor experiments. The operator 
calculus and the mapping scheme are described in detail.
