Representations for Space Planning
.W
Problems involving the arrangement of objects in two- 
or three-space where the objective function primarily consists
of derivatives of the distance between objects or their arrangement
are called space planning problems.  The representational
requirements for this problem area are defined and compared with current
computer graphic languages.  Four alternative data structures
that allow automated space planning are described and compared.
