On the Numerical Solution of an N-Point Boundary
Value Problem for Linear Ordinary Differential 
Equations
.W
A method for the numerical solution of then-point
boundary value problem for homogeneous linear 
ordinary differential equations is developed.  The
method requires two Runge-Kutta integrations over 
the interval under consideration and the solution of
a linear system of equations with n-1 unknowns.
