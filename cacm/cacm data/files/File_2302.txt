Computers and Employment
.W
The relationship of computers and automation
to employment is part of the more general relation 
of technological change to employment.  The most obvious
effect is that increase in productivity due 
to technology can eliminate jobs.  Technology affects
the individual worker, in the nature and amount 
of his work, and in his attitudes toward that work.  Technological
change affects the occupational structure 
of the entire labor force.  Because of the central importance
of these effects, the impact of technology 
has been the subject of extensive study by economists, sociologists,
political scientists, and psychologists. 
 Even within a single discipline, studies are often contradictory,
and conclusions are colored by political 
overtones.  We wish to delineate some of the issues,
and present arguments given to support different 
viewpoints.
