Computer Science Faculties: The Current Status of Minorities and Women
.W
The results of a survey conducted in the fall
of 1975 to determine the status of women and 
minority faculty members in academic computer science
are presented.  Faculty members were compared with 
respect to professional background, salaries, teaching
load, publication records, and research grants. 
 Analysis of the data indicated that the over-all verdict
is one of general equality among women, minorities, 
and men.
