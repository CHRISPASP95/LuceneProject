Error Bounds for Periodic Quintic Splines
.W
Explicit error bounds for periodic quintic spline
interpolation are developed.  The first (third) 
derivative of the periodic spline is shown to be a sixth
(fourth) order approximation at the mesh points 
to the first (third) derivative of the function being interpolated.
