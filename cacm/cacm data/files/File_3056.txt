Counting Large Numbers of Events in Small Registers
.W
It is possible to use a small counter to keep
approximate counts of large numbers.  The resulting 
expected error can be rather precisely controlled.  An
example is given in which 8-bit counters (bytes) 
are used to keep track of as many as 130,000 events with
a relative error which is substantially independent 
of the number n of events.  This relative error can
be expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of 
the time (i.e.o = n/8).  The techniques could be used
to advantage in multichannel counting hardware 
or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes.
