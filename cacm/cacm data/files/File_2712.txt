Horner's Rule for the Evaluation of General Closed Queueing Networks
.W
The solution of separable closed queueing networks
requires the evaluation of homogeneous multinomial 
expressions.  The number of terms in those expressions
grows combinatorially with the size of the network 
such that a direct summation may become impractical.  An
algorithm is given which does not show a combinatorial 
operation count.  The algorithm is based on a generalization
of Horner's rule for polynomials.  It is 
also shown how mean queue size and throughput an be obtained
at negligible extra cost once the normalization 
constant is evaluated.
