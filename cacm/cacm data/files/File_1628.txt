The Emergence of a Profession
.W
Computer programming deals with an enormous
variety of activities and is carried on by people 
with a great variety of backgrounds.  It seems clear
that part but not all of this activity is evolving 
toward a distinct professional field, but that the
scope of this emerging profession, and some of its 
economic, social, and educational characteristics are
as yet by no means well defined.  In this paper, 
these issues are examined and some opinions about them are expressed.
