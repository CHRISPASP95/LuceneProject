An Algorithm for the Approximate Solution
of Wiener-Hopf Integral Equations
.W
An explicit approximate solution is given for
an equation.  Where it is assumed that the classical 
Wiener-Hopf technique may be applied.  It is furthermore
assumed that Fourier transforms are known explicitly. 
 The approximate solution depends on two positive parameters.
