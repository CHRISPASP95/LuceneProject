Note on Triple-Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic with 132-Bit Numbers
.W
In a recent paper, Gregory and Raney described
a technique for double-precision floating-point 
arithmetic.  A similar technique can be developed for
triple-precision floating-point arithmetic and 
it is  the purpose of this note to describe this technique.
 Only the multiplication and the division 
algorithms are described, since the addition-subtraction
algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification 
of the algorithm in Gregory's and Raney's paper.
