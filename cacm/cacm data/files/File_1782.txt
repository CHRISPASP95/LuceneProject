A Numerical Integration Formula Useful in Fourier Analysis
.W
A numerical integration formula is presented which
uses unequal sampling intervals.  The intervals 
are equally spaced on a log scale.  Such a formulation
is useful in Fourier analysis to improve accuracy 
and ease of usage.  A complete set of formulas
for numerical Fourier analysis is given.
