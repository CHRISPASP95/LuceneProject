Parameters for Pseudo Runge-Kutta Methods
.W
The object of this note is to present a choice
of the free parameters in the third- and fourth-order 
pseudo Runge-Kutta methods involving two points. This
choice of parameters causes a bound on the principal 
part of the truncation error term to be near the minimum
for the fourth-order method and at the minimum 
for the third-order method.
