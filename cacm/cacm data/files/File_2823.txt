The Status of Women and Minorities in Academic Computer Science
.W
The results of a survey concerning women and
minority students and faculty in computer science 
during the years 1971 to 1975 are presented.  Analysis
of the data indicated that effective affirmative 
action programs for recruitment into graduate degree
programs are needed to enlarge the number of women 
and minorities qualified for later employment in computer
science.  Also, possible discrimination in 
employment of women and minority graduate students was revealed.
