Emulation of Large Systems
.W
The conversion problem and a new technique
called emulation are discussed.  The technique of 
emulation is developed and includes sections on both the
Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Input/Output 
unit (I/O).  This general treatment is followed by three
sections that describe in greater detail the 
implementation of compatibility features using the emulation
techniques for the IBM 7074, 7080 and 7090 
systems on IBM System/360.
