Octal Diagrams of Binary Conception and
Their Applicability to Computer Design Logic
.W
This paper dates back the genesis of binary
conception circa 5000 years ago, and octal diagrams 
about 4800 years ago, as derived by the Chinese ancients.
 It analyzes the applicability of binary trinities 
of the octal diagrams to modern electronic-digital-computer design logic.
