Computer Routine for Quadratic and Linear
Programming Problems [H] (Algorithm A431)
.W
A computer program based on Lemke's complementary
pivot algorithm is presented.  This can be 
used to solve linear and quadratic programming problems.
 The program has been extensively tested on
a wide range of problems and the results have been extremely satisfactory.
