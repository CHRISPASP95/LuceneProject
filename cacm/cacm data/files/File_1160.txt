CAT: A 7090-3600 Computer-Aided Translation
.W
A semi-automatic translation system has been implemented
which converts 7090 FAP language programs 
into 3600 assembly language.  The input to the system
is a FAP program deck which has been specially 
prepared for translation by the user.  The output consists
of the translated COMPASS language program 
together with a comprehensive diagnostic listing which the
user must analyze in order to verify any questionable 
areas of the translation.  The translation processor
consists of three distinct phases: an assembly of 
the FAP program, a comprehensive analysis of the assembled
code with particular regard to the actions 
of instructions upon other instructions and upon data,
and finally the output pass which generates the 
COMPASS program in the form of macro instructions.
