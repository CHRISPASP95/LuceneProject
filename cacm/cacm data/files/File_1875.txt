Polynomial and Spline Approximation by Quadratic Programming
.W
The problem of approximation to a given function,
or of fitting a given set of data, where 
the approximating function is required to have certain
of its derivations of specified sign over the 
whole range of approximation, is studied.  Two approaches
are presented, in each of which quadratic programming 
is used to provide both the constraints on the derivatives
and the selection of the function which yields 
the best fit.  The first is a modified Bernstein polynomial
scheme, and the second is a spline fit.
