An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding
in Circular Configurations of Processes
.W
This note presents an improvement to LeLann's
algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.
This decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective
message extinction in order to achieve an average number of
message passes of order (n log n) rather than O(n2).
