A stereographic display terminal has been
produced using the raster display (BRAD) recently 
developed at Brookhaven.  The system uses a rotating refresh
memory to feed standard television monitors. 
 To produce a stereographic display the computer calculates
the projected video images of an object, 
viewed from two separate points.  The resulting video
maps are stored on separate refresh bands of the 
rotating memory.  The two output signals are connected
to separate color guns of a color television monitor, 
thus creating a superimposed image on the screen.  Optical
separation is achieved by viewing the image 
through color filters.  The display is interactive and
can be viewed by a large group of people at the 
same time.
