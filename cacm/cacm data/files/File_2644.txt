A Theorem-Proving Language for Experimentation
.W
Because of the large number of strategies
and inference rules presently under consideration 
in automated theorem proving, there is a need for developing
a language especially oriented toward automated 
theorem proving.  This paper discusses some of the features
and instructions of this language.  The use 
of this language permits easy extension of automated
theorem-proving programs to include new strategies 
and/or new inference rules.  Such extend ability will
permit general experimentation with the various 
alternative systems.
