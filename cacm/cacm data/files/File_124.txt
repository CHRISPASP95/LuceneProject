An Algorithm for the Assignment Problem
.W
The assignment problem is formulated and briefly
discussed.  An efficient algorithm for its 
solution is presented in ALGOL code.  An empirical relation
between solution time and the size of the 
problem is given, based on extensive experiments
carried out on a digital computer.
