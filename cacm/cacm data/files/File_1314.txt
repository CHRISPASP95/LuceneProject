The Organization of Symbol Tables
.W
An efficient symbol table organization is an
important feature in the design of any compiler. 
 During the construction of the Virginia ALGOL 60 compiler
for the Burroughs B205, the primary consideration 
in the symbol table design was that the recognition of
identifiers and reserved words should be as rapid 
as possible.  The general features of the technique are described.
