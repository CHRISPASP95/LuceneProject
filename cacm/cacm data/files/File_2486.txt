Computer Photocomposition of Technical Text
.W
In computer assisted typesetting by means of
photocomposition, special problems arise in highly 
technical material such as mathematical formulas.  New
solutions to several of these problems have been 
devised in the information system of the American Institute
of Physics.  They include: the representation 
of special characters (foreign alphabets, mathematical
symbols, etc.) not available on input keyboards 
or on the photocomposer; the generation of such symbols,
e.g. by overprinting; the precise positioning 
of accent marks (floating diacritics); line breaks,
i.e. words or formulas placed partly at the end of 
one line and partly at the beginning of the next;
and certain aspects of error correction.
