A Correctness Proof of a Topology Information
Main tenance Protocol for a Distributed Computer 
Network
.W
In order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  Since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  One of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  The Topology
Information Protocol that was implemented on the 
MERIT Computer Network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  It is based on Baran's "Hot
Potato Heuristic Routing Doctrine."  A correctness 
proof of this Topology Information Protocol is also presented.
