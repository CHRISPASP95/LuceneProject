Synthesis of Decision Rules

Decision tables can be used as an effective
tool during an interview to record the logic of 
processes to be automated.  The result of such an interview
is not a structure of complete decision tables 
but rather sets of decision rules.  The purpose of this
paper is to provide a procedure for synthesizing 
the decision rules and thus provide an aid in developing
a structure of complete decision tables.
