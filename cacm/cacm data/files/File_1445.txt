Use of the Computer to Teach Introductory Statistics
.W
It has always been obvious that the aid to calculation
offered by the computer forces a change 
in the curricula of mathematics, statistics, physics,
engineering and other courses.  Not so obvious 
are the many pedagogic aids the computer can offer in
teaching the subject matter.  The possibilities 
of giving the student a better technical as well as conceptual
understanding of statistics were explored 
for a number of years at the College of Medicine of
the University of Cincinnati and are reported here.
