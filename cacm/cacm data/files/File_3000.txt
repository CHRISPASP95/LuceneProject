Segment Sizes and Lifetimes in Algol 60 Programs
.W
The characteristics of the virtual memory requirements
of a sample of Algol 60 programs have 
been measured.  Distributions are presented for thesizes
of memory requests and for their holding times 
(lifetimes).  The results are presented in terms of Johnston's
contour model and a simple abstract machine. 
 They provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects
of the construction and behavior of real programs, 
and some of their implications for the design of virtual
memory systems are presented and discussed.
