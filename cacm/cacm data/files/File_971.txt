Time Sharing in a Traffic Control Program
.W
The Toronto traffic signal control system consists
of a variety of logically distinct computer 
programs, all competing for machine time.  To satisfy
these demands, a time-sharing program has been 
written whose purpose is to execute, in the order of a
predefined priority, the various subprograms within 
the real-time system.  In this paper the more interesting
aspects of the time-sharing program are outlined.
