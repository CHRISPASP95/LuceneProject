Levels of Language for Portable Software
.W
An increasing amount of software is being
implemented in a portable form.  A popular way of 
accomplishing this is to encode the software in a specially
designed machine-independent language and 
then to map this language, often using a macro processor,
into the assembly language of each desired 
object machine.  The design of the machine-independent
language is the key factor in this operation. 
 This paper discusses the relative merits of pitching
this language at a high level or a low level, and 
presents some comparative results.
