Robot Data Screening: A Solution to Multivariate
Type Problems in the Biological and Social Sciences
.W
A new approach is outlined toward the solution
of the type of multivariate problem that is 
found usually in the biological and social sciences as
well as in medicine.  This approach uses a "logical" 
rather than a "statistical" criterion by which variables
are grouped into a deterministic model.  Algorithm 
are developed by which some variables are kept on for
further analysis while others are eliminated.  
Criteria for the acceptance of a variable as well as the
termination of the searching process are derived 
from information theory.
