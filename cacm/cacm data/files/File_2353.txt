Fast Finite-Difference Solution of Biharmonic Problems

Setting the Reynolds number equal to zero, in
a method for solving the Navier-Strokes equations 
numerically, results in a fast numerical method for
biharmonic problems.  The equation is treated as 
a system of two second order equations and a simple
smoothing process is essential for convergence.  
An application is made to a crack-type problem.
