Systematic Generation of Hamiltonian Circuits
.W
For a combinatorial matrix which may specify
both directed and nondirected arcs, the paper 
describes a computer program which generates systematically
and exhaustively all the Hamiltonian circuits. 
Specific application is made to the "traveling salesman" problem.
