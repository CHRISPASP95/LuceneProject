An Implementation of Structured Walk-Throughs
in Teaching Cobol Programming
.W
The effectiveness of structured
walk-throughs in teaching introductory Cobol programming was empirically
assessed with a sample of 215 under-graduate business administration
majors.  Cobol proficiency was measured by a final examination
testing (a) knowledge of language rules, (b) ability to read
and debug a program, and (c) the ability to write a program.  Analysis
of multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust test
scores for age and conditional reasoning scores. The findings provide
empirical support for incorporating structured walk-throughs
into the programming learning process more effectively
develop student proficiency in writing Cobol programs.
