Interactive Consulting via Natural Language
.W
Interactive programming systems often contain
help commands to give the programmer on-line 
instruction regarding the use of the various systems
commands.  It is argued that it would be relatively 
easy to make these help commands significantly more
helpful by having them accept requests in natural 
language.  As a demonstration, Weizenbaum's ELIZA program
has been provided with a script that turns 
it into a natural language system consultant.
