Logic-Structure Tables
.W
Logic tables are an excellent way of developing
and expressing the logic required in procedures, 
operations, systems and circuits.  A set of rules for
writing and using logic tables is explained by 
means of some simple examples.  Then the logic structure
of a vending machine is given in which two logic 
tables are used.  Logic tables are two-dimensional in
nature, enabling us to fully express and consider 
both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic.  They
can be compiled directly into a computer program 
and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding.
