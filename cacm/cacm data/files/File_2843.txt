.W
This paper describes a set of tools and a philosophy
for teaching software that have been found 
very useful in course at MIT over the past seven years.
 The tools include programs such as simulators, 
graders, compilers, and monitor.  These allow the instructor
to augment the basic concepts with relevant, 
exciting, and economical student project activities.
