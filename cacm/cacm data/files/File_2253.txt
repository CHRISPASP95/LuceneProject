Index Ranges for Matrix Calculi
.W
The paper describes a scheme for symbolic
manipulation of index expressions which arise as 
a by-product of the symbolic manipulation of expressions
in the matrix calculi described by the authors 
in a previous paper.  This scheme attempts program optimization
by transforming the original algorithm 
rather than the machine code.  The goal is to automatically
generate code for handling the tedious address 
calculations necessitated by complicated data structures.
 The paper is therefore preoccupied with "indexing 
by position."  The relationship of "indexing by
name" and "indexing by position" is discussed.
